The `\[ \]` delimiters are called **LaTeX display math delimiters** or  **LaTeX bracket delimiters** .

More specifically:

* `\[ \]` - Display math mode (creates a centered equation on its own line)
* `\( \)` - Inline math mode (embeds math within text)

These are standard LaTeX commands for typesetting mathematical expressions. They're part of the original TeX/LaTeX syntax created by Donald Knuth and Leslie Lamport.

In contrast, the `$ $` and `$$ $$` delimiters are called **dollar sign delimiters** and are more commonly used in Markdown-based systems like Obsidian, Jupyter notebooks, and various static site generators.
